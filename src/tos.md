Welcome to DCOS.io.  Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website (the “Website”).  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Website, please contact us at contact@dcos.io.

These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Mesosphere, Inc. (“Mesosphere,” “we” and “us”).   You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Website.  Your use of the Website in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Website.  These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).

## I thought you said DC/OS was open source?

It is!  DC/OS is available under the terms of the Apache Software License, version 2.0.   Your use of DC/OS shall be governed by (and nothing in these Terms will limit your rights under) the Apache Software License, version 2.0.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Website, so these Terms may need to change along with the Website.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the DCOS.io website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Website.  If you use the Website in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What about my privacy?

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us.  If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

The Website may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Website?

The Website may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Mesosphere. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Mesosphere is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

# Hello, DC/OS Community!

On my first day as Mesosphere’s first official DC/OS Community Manager, I assumed that I was walking into a green-field community. DC/OS had only been open source for a few months, and many of the support structures that enable community action were not (and still are not) yet in place. I was expecting to start tackling questions like, “How do we attract members to our community?” and, “How can we motivate people to engage with DC/OS?”

As everyone who is reading this knows, these questions were pretty naive. The DC/OS community is up and running: the community slack has 2,680 members, the mailing list has 290 members, and DC/OS had over 60 launch partners for its open-source debut on April 19th. Mesosphere is one stakeholder of thousands in the DC/OS community, and all of those stakeholders are as passionate about using and contributing to DC/OS as we are. My questions have changed in the last few weeks. Now, I’m also asking myself what I can do to help the DC/OS community succeed, and what I can do to help Mesosphere be a good member and steward of that community. I’d like to propose three things I can do in the short term, and ask for your help and advice.

## My near-term proposals for the community:
1. I will listen to your concerns - This one might sound obvious, but the fact is that Mesosphere hasn’t had the bandwidth to comprehensively track community concerns before. Lots of awesome Mesosphere employees (and other community members; thank you!) have been answering technical questions on slack and the mailing list, but they haven’t had the resources to track and address issues with the DC/OS community itself, or how Mesosphere interacts with its fellow members. I will be doing just that, so please keep bringing up your great ideas and any concerns!
2. I will increase transparency - My dad used to tell me that possession is nine tenths of the law; I think that saying holds true for information even more than physical belongings. I would eventually like the community to possess all the information that Mesosphere has about DC/OS (its current state, and the direction of its progress) so that it can truly own DC/OS. Feel free to request any types of information you’d like to see sooner rather than later, and I’ll do my best to get it out there. In the last couple weeks I’ve already heard a few requests that we’re working on. For example, we’re going to be publishing more design docs, migration guides, and other update announcements. It’s hard to know what we don’t know, so I expect we will iterate on this faster as Mesosphere gets more proactive about sharing information with its fellow community members.
3. I will advocate for community concerns - While DC/OS was closed source, Mesosphere made decisions about the direction of DC/OS as a product, and contributed substantial resources toward developing it. Having open sourced the code, we are now building the processes to fairly incorporate community feedback about the direction of DC/OS. We want every community member to have a say proportional to their commitment to the project. Eventually there will be a systematic way for Mesosphere's fellow community members to speak up, but in the meantime if you have concerns about DC/OS or the community let me know, and I will make sure they are heard.

## Things that I’d love your help with:
1. If something seems weird, bring it up - From unclear documentation to cryptic communication from community members (including Mesosphere, and me), weird stuff happens, and it’s worth noting rather than glossing over. Please bring up weird stuff (for example, opacity about whether features are open or enterprise) either to me personally or the community in general. It could be a good opportunity for improvement!
2. Please reach out to me this week, even if it’s just to say hi - I’m newer to the DC/OS community than many of you, and the thing I’m looking forward to the most about my work here is getting to know each of you. Please send me a note and introduce yourself; I’d love to open up a conversation! My slack handle is judith.mesosphere, and my email is jmalnick@mesosphere.com. Ping me any time.

When I’m not hanging out in the DC/OS community, I’m S.C.U.B.A. diving, hiking, zipping around on my motorcycle, and trying to garden. I was a biologist in a previous life, so if you want to know about the quirks of starfish evolution or cancer genotyping, I’m your girl. I’ve also been a volunteer crisis counselor, nuclear reactor operator, and a dance teacher. I’m curious about pretty much everyone and everything, and I’d love to hear from you!
